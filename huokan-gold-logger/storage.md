# Huokan Gold Logger Storage

The log file can be found here: `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\WTF\Account\YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\SavedVariables\!HuokanGoldLogger.lua`

Each element of the `HuokanGoldLog` table is JSON that is then compressed and base64 encoded. Elements may be an object or an array of objects (in order to compress more than one together to save space).
