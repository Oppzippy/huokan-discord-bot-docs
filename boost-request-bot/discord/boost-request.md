# Boost Request Module
\<> will indicate required arguments and [] will indicate optional arguments in commands on this page.

## Requirements
The bot requires some permissions for this module to function.
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Add Reactions
- Manage Messages

## Usage
### Request Logging
**!boostrequest setlogchannel \<#channel>**  
All boost requests will be logged to this channel upon creation along with the requester's discord tag and a @mention.

**!boostrequest removelogchannel**  
Stops logging.

### Channels
**!boostrequest channels**  
Lists all boost request channels on the server.

**!boostrequest addchannel \<#frontend-channel> \<#backend-channel>**  
Adds a boost request channel. The frontend channel must be unique. If the frontend and backend channel are the same, reactions (üëç, ‚è≠) will be applied directly to the request message and the requester will not recieve a DM. This is intended for boost requests created via webhooks.

**!boostrequest removechannel \<#frontend-channel>**  
Removes a boost request channel. This doesn't delete the discord channels; it just unregisters them for receiving boost requests.

**!boostrequest removechannels**  
Removes **ALL** boost request channels from the server. This doesn't delete the discord channels; it just unregisters them for receiving boost requests.

### Privileges

**!boostrequest privileges**  
Lists all advertiser privileges.

**!boostrequest setprivileges \<@role> \<weight> \<delayInSeconds>**  
Assigns privileges to an advertiser role.  
\<weight>: When randomly choosing an advertiser, the weight will be applied to advertisers of this role. This can be any positive number greater than 0.  
\<delayInSeconds>: Time the role must wait after the creation of a boost request in order to be able to claim it. All advertisers with roles that must wait the same amount of time are grouped together, and whichever group has the lowest delay will be chosen from. This must be a positive integer.

**!boostrequest removeprivileges \<@role>**  
Removes privileges to use the boost request bot from a role.

### Discounts

**!boostrequest rolediscounts**  
Lists all role discounts.

**!boostrequest setrolediscount \<@role> \<boostType> \<discount%>**  
Sets a discount for all boost requests from a role. `boostType` can be anything, but the names must be consistent acrcoss roles in order for the best discount to be selected for people with more than one role that provides discounts. Basically, don't call it `mythic+` for one role and `m+` for another. Quotes can be used if there are spaces in the name of the boost type.  
Example: !boostrequest setrolediscount @Booster "Castle Nathria" 10%

**!boostrequest removerolediscount \<@role> \<boostType>**  
Removes the discount for a role. Example: !boostrequest removerolediscount @Booster Mythic+

### Steal Credits

**!boostrequest credits [@user...]**  
Checks your boost request steal credits. If arguments are provided, each user's boost request steal credits will be checked instead.

**!boostrequest addcredits \<@user> \<credits>**  
Add boost request steal credits to a user.

**!boostrequest setcredits \<@role> \<credits>**  
Sets a user's boost request steal credits.

### Roll Logging
**!boostrequest setrollchannel \<#channel>**  
Sets a channel to log RNG rolls to.

**!boostrequest removerollchannel**  
Stops logging RNG rolls.

### Webhooks
**!boostrequest setwebhook \<webhookUrl>**  
Sets a URL that will receive a POST request every time a webhook event occurs. There can only be one webhook set at a time, so if a webhook already exists, it will be replaced with the new url.

**!boostrequest removewebhook**  
Deactivates webhooks.

**!boostrequest webhook**  
Sends you the webhook url in a direct message.
